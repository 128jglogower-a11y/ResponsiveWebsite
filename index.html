      <h2>Victor Wembanyama</h2>
      <p>Victor Wembanyama is a 22-year old, 7’6 center from France, playing his third year in the NBA. Victor is known for his wide range skillset, showing skills that centers don’t normally have, such as elite 3 point shooting and handles. It’s rare for a player of his size to be such a complete player, which is what makes him so special. He is nearly unstoppable on offense, and if you try to score on him, he’ll send your shot flying across the arena. There’s not many who can do what he does at his level.</p>
